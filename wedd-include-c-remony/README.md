# Assignment 0423: Wedd-include C-remony
First things first: pun-assist credit goes to Dr. Forney for finding a way to combine C with the idea of a wedding üôåüèΩ

Presumably, the C and `#include` parts are obvious; what about the wedding? Well, that‚Äôs because this assignment has‚Ä¶
* Something old
* Something new
* Something borrowed

Nothing blue though. That‚Äôs just too much.

## Background Reading
As before, most of the information you need can be found in Dr. Toal‚Äôs [Introduction to C](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/c) page, as well as many other C programming sites on the web. His assembly-language pages, particularly the [NASM Tutorial page](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/) will also be of use for the ‚ÄúSystem Call Me Maybe‚Äù portion of the assignment.

Make sure to also check out the _Async Sessions_ section in Brightspace for a range of videos that are specifically meant to supplement the C page with information that is directly relevant to this assignment.

## For Submission: Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed

### Something Old: Chord Consolidated
Specific instructions for this portion can be found in the [chord-consolidated](./chord-consolidated) folder.

### Something New: Mine-C-Weeper
Specific instructions for this portion can be found in the [mine-c-weeper](./mine-c-weeper) folder.

### Something Borrowed: System Call Me Maybe
Specific instructions for this portion can be found in the [system-call-me-maybe](./system-call-me-maybe) folder.

### Nothing Blue
There is no ‚Äúsomething blue‚Äù portion.

## How to Turn it In
Commit your source code (and _just_ the source code) to this repository, in their designated folders/directories. Note that starter files for most programs have already been supplied, so all you need to do is edit or update them.

## Specific Point Allocations
This assignment is scored according to outcomes _2a_ to _2d_, _3a_ to _3c_, and _4a_ to _4f_ in the [syllabus](https://dondi.lmu.build/spring2020/cmsi284/cmsi284-spring2020-syllabus.pdf). For this particular assignment, graded categories are as follows:

| Category | Points | Outcomes |
| -------- | -----: | -------- |
| Chord Consolidated | 10 points total | _3a_, _4a_, _4b_ |
| Mine-C-Weeper | 100 points total | _2b_, _3a_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_ |
| System Call Me Maybe | 40 points total | _2c_, _2d_, _3a_, _3b_, _3c_, _4a_, _4c_, _4d_ |
| Hard-to-maintain or error-prone code | deduction only | _4b_ |
| Hard-to-read code | deduction only | _4c_ |
| Version control | deduction only | _4e_ |
| Punctuality | deduction only | _4f_ |
| **Total** | **150** |

Note that inability to compile and run to begin with will negatively affect the correctness of program output and proper handling of invalid user input.
